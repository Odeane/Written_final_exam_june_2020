## Written submission
Please explain the steps you think are necessary to perform to get a feature done, from an idea to an implemented solution that is running in production. Be as detailed as possible.

After the idea is presented, the team will gather for a design sprint. This sprint usually last 
for four or five days. The first step will be to create some user stories for the main functionality requirements. These stories are ususally large, therefore the team needs to identify small features from these user stories and create user stories that defines smaller features. The team then needs to identify the neccessary chores that needs to be done before these selected features. After a set of chores and features are selected they are added to the project backlog. An acceptance criteria is then identified for each feature to set a criteria as to when should these stories be considered done. After this, the team then votes on the story based on how complex the story is. The team then select a feature and begin to work. The team will work iteratively over each feature. At the end of the design sprint  a sprint review is held in which accepted features will be shipped in production.
